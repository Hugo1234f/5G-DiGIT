1. Remove the following data: scenario, distance_w, id, 
    Time, Date, UTC, campaign, Latitude, Longitude,
    Altitude, Speed, EARFCN, Band, PCI, MNC

2. Aggregate high correlations (>= 0.8):
    SSS-SINR / SSS-RSRQ: 0.935
    DM_RS-SINR / DM_RS-RSRQ: 0.935
    PBCH-SINR / PBCH-RSRQ: 0.935
    PSS-SINR / PSS-RSRQ: 0.928
    SS_PBCH-SINR / SS_PBCH-RSRQ: 0.936

3. Scale values:
    Frequencies were mapped to 0/1. Sklearn' StandardScalar was used to scale the rest of the data. 
    Every 10th row was also saved as training data. This was to reduce the training data from 800MB to 80MB, 
    which given that my clustering algorithm trains in O(n log n) time is really helpful.

4. Training:
